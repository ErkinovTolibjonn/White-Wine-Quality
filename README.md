🍾 White Wine Quality Prediction using PyTorch & Machine Learning

This project predicts the quality of white wine based on its chemical properties (acidity, sugar, sulfur dioxide, density, pH, alcohol, etc.) using PyTorch Neural Networks and Machine Learning models.

🚀 Overview

We analyze the Wine Quality (White) Dataset, train a PyTorch Neural Network, and compare its performance with Random Forest and Naive Bayes classifiers to estimate wine quality scores (0–10).
